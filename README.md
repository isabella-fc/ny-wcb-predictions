# Claim Injury Type Prediction for NY Workers' Compensation Board

This project focuses on building a multiclass classification model to predict the **Claim Injury Type** within the New York Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) system. The goal is to automate and improve the consistency of claim evaluations, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing processing time.

## Overview

Millions of compensation claims are filed and evaluated by the WCB. While reforms have improved processes, the growing volume and complexity of cases continue to pose challenges. By applying machine learning, this project aims to support faster and more consistent decision-making.
